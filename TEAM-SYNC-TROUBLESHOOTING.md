# Team Sync Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **Problem: Teammates Can't See Your Updated Code**

### **Possible Causes & Solutions:**

## 1. **Repository Mismatch** 🔄

**Problem:** Your teammates are looking at the wrong repository.

**Check:**
```bash
# Check your current repository
git remote -v

# Should show: https://github.com/mjpogi01/capstone2.git
```

**Solution:**
- Make sure all teammates are looking at the same repository
- Share the correct repository URL: `https://github.com/mjpogi01/capstone2`

## 2. **Branch Issues** 🌿

**Problem:** You're on a different branch than your teammates.

**Check:**
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Check all branches
git branch -a
```

**Solution:**
- Make sure everyone is on the `main` branch
- Switch to main: `git checkout main`

## 3. **Not Pulling Latest Changes** 📥

**Problem:** Teammates haven't pulled your latest changes.

**Solution for Teammates:**
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Or use auto-sync
team-auto-sync.bat
```

## 4. **Cache Issues** 💾

**Problem:** Browser or Git cache is showing old content.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear Git cache
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/main

# Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
```

## 5. **Authentication Issues** 🔐

**Problem:** Teammates don't have access to the repository.

**Check:**
- Make sure teammates are logged into GitHub
- Verify they have access to the repository
- Check if they're using the correct credentials

## 6. **Merge Conflicts** ⚔️

**Problem:** There are conflicts preventing updates.

**Check:**
```bash
# Check for conflicts
git status

# If conflicts exist, resolve them
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Solution:**

### **For You (The One Pushing):**

1. **Verify your push was successful:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   # Should show: "Everything up-to-date" or successful push
   ```

2. **Check your repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/mjpogi01/capstone2
   - Verify your latest commits are there
   - Check the commit history

3. **Share the repository URL with your team:**
   ```
   https://github.com/mjpogi01/capstone2
   ```

### **For Your Teammates:**

1. **Check their current repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   # Should show: https://github.com/mjpogi01/capstone2.git
   ```

2. **Pull the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Or use auto-sync:**
   ```bash
   team-auto-sync.bat
   ```

4. **Verify they got the updates:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   # Should show your latest commits
   ```

## 🎯 **Quick Fix Commands:**

### **For Teammates to Get Your Updates:**

```bash
# Method 1: Manual pull
git fetch origin
git pull origin main

# Method 2: Auto-sync (recommended)
team-auto-sync.bat

# Method 3: Force update (if needed)
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/main
```
