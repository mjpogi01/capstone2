## 🔧 How It Works

### Filter Flow
1. User interacts with any filter (category, price, rating)
2. State updates trigger `filterAndSortProducts()`
3. Products are filtered by:
   - Search term (if any)
   - Selected categories (checkbox OR)
   - Price range (min/max)
   - Rating (minimum rating threshold)
4. Filtered products update in real-time
5. Pagination resets to page 1

### Filter Logic
```javascript
// Category: Shows products in ANY selected category
if (selectedCategories.length > 0) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(product => 
    selectedCategories.includes(product.category)
  );
}

// Price: Shows products within range
if (priceMin) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(product => 
    parseFloat(product.price) >= parseFloat(priceMin)
  );
}

// Rating: Shows products with rating >= selected
if (selectedRating) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(product => 
    (product.rating || product.average_rating || 0) >= selectedRating
  );
}
```

## 📝 Notes

- **Rating Data**: The filter assumes products have a `rating` or `average_rating` field. If your products don't have ratings yet, the filter will still work (treating them as 0 stars).
- **Mobile Experience**: On mobile, the sidebar is hidden and users rely on the top filter bar. Consider adding a mobile filter drawer in the future if needed.
- **Category Filter**: The sidebar uses checkboxes for multi-select, while the top bar has a single-select dropdown for backward compatibility.
