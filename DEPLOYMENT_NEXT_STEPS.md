- [x] `.htaccess` file created

---

## 🚀 Next Steps - Complete Checklist

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Live on Render ⚠️

**Check if your backend is deployed:**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard:**
   - Visit [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Find your web service (e.g., `yohanns-api`)

2. **Check Status:**
   - Status should show **"Live"** (green)
   - If still building, wait for deployment to complete

3. **Get Your Backend URL:**
   - Your backend URL should be: `https://yohanns-api.onrender.com`
   - (Replace with your actual Render service name)

4. **Test Backend Health:**
   - Visit: `https://yohanns-api.onrender.com/health`
   - Should return: `{"ok":true}`
   - ✅ **If this works:** Your backend is live!

**If backend is NOT deployed yet:**
- Follow `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- Complete backend deployment first

---

### Step 2: Verify Frontend is Live on Hostinger ✅

**Check if your frontend is accessible:**

1. **Visit Your Website:**
   - Go to `https://yourdomain.com` (or your Hostinger domain)
   - Your React app should load!

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press `F12` to open DevTools
   - Go to **"Console"** tab
   - Check for errors
   - ✅ **Should see:** API URL logged (check what it says)

3. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Open **"Network"** tab in DevTools
   - Try to use your app (login, load products, etc.)
   - Look for API calls
   - ✅ **Should see:** API calls going to Render backend URL

**If frontend is NOT working:**
- Check file structure in Hostinger
- Verify `index.html` is in `public_html/`
- Check browser console for specific errors

---

### Step 3: Verify API Connection 🔗

**Make sure frontend can connect to backend:**

1. **Test API Endpoint:**
   - Visit: `https://yohanns-api.onrender.com/api/products` (or any API route)
   - Should return JSON data or appropriate response

2. **Check CORS:**
   - In browser console (Network tab), look for CORS errors
   - If you see CORS errors, backend CORS needs configuration

3. **Update Backend CORS (if needed):**
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Environment
   - Make sure these are set:
     ```
     FRONTEND_URL = https://yourdomain.com
     CLIENT_URL = https://yourdomain.com
     ```
   - Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual Hostinger domain
   - Restart service or wait for auto-deploy

---

### Step 4: Set Up UptimeRobot (Keep Backend Awake) ⏰

**Prevent cold starts on Render free tier:**

1. **Go to UptimeRobot:**
   - Visit [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com)
   - Sign up (free account)

2. **Add Monitor:**
   - Click **"+ Add New Monitor"**
   - **Monitor Type:** `HTTP(s)`
   - **Friendly Name:** `Yohanns API`
   - **URL:** `https://yohanns-api.onrender.com/health`
   - **Interval:** `5 minutes`
   - Click **"Create Monitor"**

3. **Verify It's Working:**
   - Monitor status should show **"Up"** (green)
   - Last check updates every 5 minutes
   - ✅ **This keeps your backend awake 24/7!**

**See:** `UPTIMEROBOT_KEEP_RENDER_AWAKE.md` for detailed guide

---

### Step 6: Fix Any Issues 🐛

**Common issues and fixes:**

#### Issue: Frontend shows blank page
**Check:**
- Browser console for errors
- File structure in Hostinger
- `index.html` is in `public_html/`

**Fix:**
- Check browser console for specific errors
- Verify all files uploaded correctly
- Make sure `index.html` exists

#### Issue: API calls failing / CORS errors
**Check:**
- Backend is live on Render
- CORS configuration in backend
- `FRONTEND_URL` and `CLIENT_URL` env vars in Render

**Fix:**
- Update environment variables in Render
- Verify backend CORS allows your domain
- Check Network tab for specific error messages

#### Issue: 404 errors when refreshing pages
**Check:**
- `.htaccess` file exists in `public_html/`
- `.htaccess` content is correct
- `mod_rewrite` is enabled on Apache

**Fix:**
- Create/verify `.htaccess` file
- Contact Hostinger support to enable `mod_rewrite` if needed

#### Issue: Images or assets not loading
**Check:**
- Files are in `static/media/` folder
- File paths are correct

**Fix:**
- Verify all files uploaded
- Check file paths in browser console

#### Issue: Backend sleeps (30-60 second delay)
**Check:**
- UptimeRobot monitor is set up
- Monitor is active and pinging

**Fix:**
- Set up UptimeRobot (Step 4 above)
- Or upgrade Render to paid plan

---

### Step 7: Update Frontend API URL (If Needed) 🔄

**If your frontend is not connecting to Render backend:**

1. **Check Current API URL:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for API URL logged
   - Check Network tab - where are API calls going?

2. **Create `.env.production` file:**
   - In project root: `C:\capstone2\capstone2\.env.production`
   - Add:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=https://yohanns-api.onrender.com
     ```
   - Replace with your actual Render backend URL

3. **Rebuild and Redeploy:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\capstone2\capstone2
   npm run build
   ```
   - Upload new `build/` contents to Hostinger
   - Replace old files

**Note:** Your code in `src/config/api.js` should handle this, but you may need to explicitly set `REACT_APP_API_URL` for production.

---

### Step 8: Monitor Your Deployment 📊

**Set up monitoring:**

1. **Backend Monitoring:**
   - ✅ UptimeRobot (already set up in Step 4)
   - Check Render logs regularly
   - Monitor service status

2. **Frontend Monitoring:**
   - Check Hostinger file manager
   - Monitor website uptime
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Error Tracking (Optional):**
   - Consider Sentry for error tracking
   - Google Analytics for user analytics
   - Render logs for backend errors

---

### Step 9: Document Your Deployment 📝

**Keep a record of important info:**

**Save these details:**
- ✅ Backend URL: `https://yohanns-api.onrender.com`
- ✅ Frontend URL: `https://yourdomain.com`
- ✅ Render service name: `yohanns-api`
- ✅ Hostinger domain: `yourdomain.com`
- ✅ Environment variables (keep secure copy)
- ✅ UptimeRobot monitor URL

**Document:**
- How to update frontend (rebuild → upload)
- How to update backend (git push → auto-deploy)
- How to access logs
- How to troubleshoot common issues

---

### Step 10: Future Updates 🔄

**How to update your app:**

#### Update Frontend:
1. Make changes locally
2. Rebuild: `npm run build`
3. Upload new `build/` contents to Hostinger
4. Clear browser cache or wait for cache to expire

#### Update Backend:
1. Make changes locally
2. Commit: `git add .` → `git commit -m "message"`
3. Push: `git push origin main`
4. Render auto-deploys (2-5 minutes)
5. Changes are live!

## 🐛 If Something's Not Working

**Quick troubleshooting:**

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Check Render logs** for backend errors
3. **Check Network tab** for failed API calls
4. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
5. **Test backend directly:** Visit Render URL + `/health`
6. **Test frontend directly:** Visit your Hostinger domain

**Common issues:**
- Backend not deployed → Deploy to Render first
