## Summary

**Issue:** The "Add Cart" button had no onClick handler and wasn't functional.

**Fix:** Added onClick handler that opens ProductModal for product customization, then adds to cart.

**Result:** Users can now:
1. Click "Add Cart" on any product

3. Add to cart successfully
4. See item in cart with correct details
5. Proceed to checkout

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the functionality in a development environment
2. Verify all test scenarios pass
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor console logs for any issues
5. Collect user feedback
