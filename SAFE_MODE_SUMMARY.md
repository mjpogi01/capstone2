# üîí Safe Mode Successfully Activated

## Status: ‚úÖ PROTECTED

Your repository is now in **SAFE MODE** and protected against accidental pushes to the main GitHub repository.

## Test Results

‚úÖ **Push Blocked**: Confirmed - pushes to origin are disabled  
‚úÖ **Fetch/Pull Working**: Confirmed - you can still get updates  
‚úÖ **Hooks Created**: Pre-push safety hooks installed  

## Quick Reference

### Current Configuration
```
origin  https://github.com/mjpogi01/capstone2 (fetch)
origin  no_push (push)
```

### What Works
- ‚úÖ `git pull origin main` - Get updates from remote
- ‚úÖ `git fetch origin` - Fetch remote changes
- ‚úÖ `git commit` - Commit locally
- ‚úÖ `git branch` - Create local branches

### What's Blocked
- ‚ùå `git push origin main` - BLOCKED
- ‚ùå `git push` - BLOCKED
- ‚ùå Auto-sync scripts - DISABLED

## Quick Commands

**Check Safe Mode Status:**
```bash
git remote -v
```

**Pull Updates (Safe):**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

**Temporarily Disable Safe Mode:**
```bash
disable-safe-mode.bat
```

**Re-enable Safe Mode:**
```bash
setup-safe-mode.bat
```

## Files Created

1. **SAFE_MODE_README.md** - Complete documentation
2. **setup-safe-mode.bat** - Quick setup script
3. **disable-safe-mode.bat** - Disable script with confirmation
4. **.git/hooks/pre-push** - Additional safety hook (Unix)
5. **.git/hooks/pre-push.bat** - Additional safety hook (Windows)

## How It Works

Safe mode uses multiple layers of protection:

1. **Push URL Override**: The push destination is set to `no_push` (invalid)
2. **Branch Configuration**: Main branch explicitly prevents pushes
3. **Push Default**: Set to `nothing` to avoid accidental pushes
4. **Hooks**: Pre-push hooks provide additional warnings

Even if you accidentally type `git push`, it will fail with:
```
fatal: 'no_push' does not appear to be a git repository
```

## When to Disable Safe Mode

You might want to temporarily disable safe mode if you need to:
- Push your work to the main repository
- Share changes with your team
- Update the remote with local changes

**Always remember to re-enable safe mode after pushing!**
