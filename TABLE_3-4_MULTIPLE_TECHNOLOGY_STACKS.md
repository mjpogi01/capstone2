## Technology Stacks Details

### Design A: Frontend Technologies
**Technologies:** JavaScript, CSS, HTML

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for frontend logic and interactivity
- **CSS**: Styling and visual design
- **HTML**: Markup structure (generated by React)

**Priority:** **Top Priority** - The researchers are already familiar with these technologies, making development faster and more efficient.

---

### Design B: Backend & Database Technologies
**Technologies:** PostgreSQL, Node.js, Supabase

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side execution
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service platform hosting PostgreSQL and providing authentication, storage, and real-time features

**Priority:** **Second Option** - Essential for system development, providing database functionality, API services, and data management.

---

### Design C: Framework & Development Libraries
**Technologies:** React.js, Express.js, Custom Charts

**Alternative Option 1:**
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js backend
- **Custom Charts**: Custom SVG-based data visualization (no external chart library)

**Alternative Option 2 (if you prefer):**
- **React.js**: Frontend framework
- **Express.js**: Backend framework  
- **Supabase Client**: Client library for connecting to Supabase services

**Priority:** Used for building the application architecture, API development, and data visualization. React.js enables component-based UI development, Express.js handles server-side routing and API endpoints, and custom charts provide analytics visualization.

---

### Design D: Development Tools & Services
**Technologies:** Git, NPM, Cloud Services

- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and code repository management
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Package dependency management
- **Cloud Services**: Cloudinary (image hosting), EmailJS/Nodemailer (email services)

**Priority:** Used for testing, storing code, organizing project files, and integrating with online services. Git enables version control and collaboration, NPM manages dependencies, and cloud services provide external integrations.

## Explanation

Based on Table 3-4, all the technology stacks shown above were important in building the system. 

- **Design A** was the **top priority** technology stack since the researchers are already familiar with using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, enabling rapid frontend development.

- **Design B** was considered as the **second option** in system development, providing essential backend infrastructure and database capabilities through PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Supabase.

- **Design C** was used to **build the application framework** with React.js for frontend components, Express.js for backend APIs, and custom chart implementations for data visualization and analytics.

- **Design D** was used for **version control, dependency management, and cloud integrations**, including Git for code storage and organization, NPM for package management, and cloud services for external service integration.
