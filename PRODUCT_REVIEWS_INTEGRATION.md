## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. **Review Database Connection**
- Reviews are stored in `order_reviews` table
- Reviews are linked to orders (not directly to products)
- When a user submits a review for an order, it affects all products in that order
- Backend automatically calculates average ratings and review counts

### 2. **Product Display Updates**
Products now show:
- **‚≠ê Average Rating**: e.g., ‚≠ê4.5 (calculated from all reviews)
- **Review Count**: Number of reviews in parentheses, e.g., (12)
- **Sold Quantity**: Number sold (if > 0)

### 3. **Star Rating Filter (Sidebar)**
- Filter products by minimum rating (1-5 stars)
- Click any star level to filter
- Shows products with that rating & above (e.g., 4‚≠ê & Up)
- Works with actual data from reviews

### 4. **Real-Time Updates**
- When users submit reviews, they're stored in `order_reviews`
- Products API calculates stats on-the-fly
- Ratings update immediately on page refresh

## üìä How Reviews Work

### Review Flow:
```
1. Customer places order ‚Üí Creates order with order_items
2. Order is completed ‚Üí Customer can leave review
3. Customer submits review ‚Üí Saved to order_reviews table
4. Review applies to all products in that order
5. Products API aggregates reviews ‚Üí Shows on Shop Now page
```

### Data Structure:

**order_reviews** table:
```sql
{
  id: UUID,
  order_id: UUID,           -- Links to orders table
  user_id: UUID,            -- User who reviewed
  rating: INTEGER (1-5),    -- Star rating
  comment: TEXT,            -- Review text
  created_at: TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}
```

**Aggregation Logic**:
```
order_reviews ‚Üí orders ‚Üí order_items ‚Üí products

For each product:
  - Find all order_items with this product_id
  - Get all order_reviews for those orders
  - Calculate AVG(rating) = average_rating
  - Calculate COUNT(*) = review_count
```

## üîç Star Rating Filter

### How It Works:

**Sidebar Filter:**
```
Rating
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê        (5 stars)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ & Up   (4 stars & up)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ & Up   (3 stars & up)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ & Up   (2 stars & up)
‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ & Up   (1 star & up)
```

**Filter Logic:**
```javascript
if (selectedRating !== null) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(product => {
    const rating = product.average_rating || 0;
    return rating >= selectedRating;
  });
}
```

**Example:**
- User clicks "4 stars & up"
- Shows products with average_rating >= 4.0
- Product with 4.5 rating: ‚úÖ Shown
- Product with 3.8 rating: ‚ùå Hidden
