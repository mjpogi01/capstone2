# Trophy Cart Details Fix

## Problem Summary

Sizes, engraving, and occasion entered in the product modal trophy details were not appearing in the cart modal - showing "N/A" instead.

## Root Cause

The database table `user_carts` was missing the `ball_details` and `trophy_details` JSONB columns to store trophy customization data.

## Solution

### 1. Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the SQL migration to add the missing columns to your Supabase database.

#### Option A: Using Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the following SQL:

```sql
-- Add ball_details and trophy_details columns to user_carts table
ALTER TABLE user_carts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ball_details JSONB;

ALTER TABLE user_carts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS trophy_details JSONB;
```

#### Option B: Using the Migration File
Run the migration file created at `server/scripts/add-ball-trophy-details.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

### 2. Code Changes Made

#### Files Modified:

1. **src/contexts/CartContext.js**
   - Added `ballDetails` and `trophyDetails` to options destructuring in `addToCart()`
   - Added these fields to the `cartItem` object creation

2. **src/services/cartService.js**
   - Added `ball_details` and `trophy_details` to the insert statement
   - Added these fields to the duplicate detection logic
   - Added these fields to the `getUserCart()` transformation

### 3. How It Works Now

**Product Modal** → collects trophy details:
```javascript
trophyDetails: {
  size: '14" (Large)',
  engravingText: 'Champions 2025',
  occasion: 'Basketball Championship'
}
```

**Cart Context** → passes details through:
```javascript
cartItem = {
  ...productInfo,
  trophyDetails: trophyDetails  // Passed from ProductModal
}
```

**Cart Service** → saves to database:
```javascript
.insert({
  ...
  trophy_details: cartItem.trophyDetails  // Saved as JSONB
})
```

**Cart Modal** → displays details:
```javascript
{item.trophyDetails?.size || 'N/A'}
{item.trophyDetails?.engravingText || 'N/A'}
{item.trophyDetails?.occasion || 'N/A'}
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Apply the database migration** (see above)
2. **Restart your development server** if it's running
3. **Test the flow**:
   - Open a trophy product
   - Fill in size, engraving, and occasion
   - Click "Add to Cart"
   - Open cart modal
   - Click "Trophy Details" to expand
   - Verify all fields show correctly (not "N/A")

## Verification Checklist

✅ Database migration applied
✅ Trophy details save to database
✅ Trophy details load from database
✅ Cart modal displays trophy details correctly
✅ No "N/A" values for filled fields
✅ Works for both "Add to Cart" and "Buy Now"

## Additional Notes

- Same fix applies to ball products (using `ballDetails` instead)
- Existing cart items won't be affected (they'll show null/undefined fields as "N/A")
- New trophy items added after migration will work correctly
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
