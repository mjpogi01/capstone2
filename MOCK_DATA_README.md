## 🛠️ Customization

### Modify Generation Parameters

Edit `generate-5-years-mock-data.js`:

```javascript
// Change date range
const startDate = new Date(2020, 0, 1);  // Start date
const endDate = new Date(2025, 9, 31);   // End date

// Adjust peak season months
function isSeasonPeak(date) {
  const month = date.getMonth() + 1;
  return month >= 3 && month <= 8;  // Change these numbers
}

// Modify order probability
let baseProbability = 0.3;  // Non-peak day probability
if (isPeak) baseProbability = 0.6;  // Peak day probability
```

### Adjust Product Mix

```javascript
// Change sublimation percentage
const isSublimation = Math.random() < 0.7;  // 70% = sublimation, 30% = other

// Change team order percentage
const isTeamOrder = Math.random() > 0.2;  // 80% = team, 20% = single

// Change cancellation rate
const isCancelled = Math.random() < 0.1;  // 10% cancellation rate
```

## ✅ Data Integrity Checks

All generated data includes:
- ✅ Valid Supabase UUIDs for all IDs
- ✅ Proper date formats (ISO 8601)
- ✅ Accurate numeric calculations
- ✅ Valid enum values for status/shipping_method
- ✅ Realistic price ranges
- ✅ Proper JSONB format for nested data
- ✅ FK references to valid branches
- ✅ Consistent data types

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Single User**: All orders belong to the first user in Supabase auth
2. **Pickup Only**: All orders use pickup shipping method
3. **No Design Files**: order_items.design_files array is empty
4. **Simplified Statuses**: Only uses `picked_up_delivered` and `cancelled`
5. **No Returns**: No order_tracking data included (delivery status tracking)

## 📝 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the data generation:
- [ ] Multiple users with varied purchasing patterns
- [ ] Different shipping methods (COD, delivery)
- [ ] Design file uploads included
- [ ] Full production workflow statuses
- [ ] Geolocation-based ordering patterns
- [ ] Seasonal product popularity changes
- [ ] Supplier and inventory tracking
- [ ] Customer retention patterns

## 🤝 Support

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I regenerate the data?**
A: Simply run the script again. It will insert new orders (duplicates are possible but unlikely given the timestamp-based order numbers).

**Q: Can I delete the old data?**
A: Yes, delete orders by user_id before regenerating:
```sql
DELETE FROM orders WHERE user_id = 'dc2e1b68-9af9-4c19-ad38-594b922e2095';
```

**Q: How accurate is the seasonality?**
A: The model accurately reflects Philippine sports seasons (Youth Week in August, summer camps Mar-May) with added randomness for realism.

**Q: Why are some days empty?**
A: That's intentional! Not every day has orders - it follows realistic business patterns.

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Script Fails to Run

**Error**: "Missing Supabase credentials"
- ✅ Check server `.env` file exists
- ✅ Ensure `SUPABASE_URL` is set
- ✅ Ensure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set

**Error**: "No users found in authentication"
- ✅ Create at least one user in Supabase auth
- ✅ Use the Supabase dashboard to add a test user

**Error**: "Could not insert orders"
- ✅ Check `orders` table exists in Supabase
- ✅ Verify table has proper schema
- ✅ Check for FK constraint violations
