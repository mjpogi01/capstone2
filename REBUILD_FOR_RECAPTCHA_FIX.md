# Why You're Still Seeing the Old Domain - Fix Explanation

## ❓ Why You See `yohanns-sportswear.onrender.com` Instead of `yohhanssportswear.com`

**The code is already fixed!** But you're seeing the **old hardcoded message** because:

1. ✅ **Code is updated** - The error message now shows the correct domain dynamically
2. ❌ **Old build is deployed** - Hostinger still has the old build with hardcoded domain
3. ⏳ **Need to rebuild** - You need to rebuild and re-upload to Hostinger

---

## 🎯 What I Fixed

**Before (OLD - Hardcoded):**
```javascript
Domain configuration: Ensure yohanns-sportswear.onrender.com is added...
```

**After (NEW - Dynamic):**
```javascript
Domain configuration: Ensure {window.location.hostname} is added...
```

**The new code will show:**
- On `yohhanssportswear.com` → Shows: `yohhanssportswear.com`
- On `localhost` → Shows: `localhost`
- Any domain → Shows the actual domain automatically!

## ✅ Solution: Rebuild and Redeploy

### Step 1: Rebuild Your React App

**On your local machine:**

```powershell
cd C:\capstone2\capstone2
npm run build
```

**This creates a new `build/` folder** with the updated code that shows the correct domain.

### Step 2: Upload New Build to Hostinger

**Replace old files:**

1. **Log into hPanel** → **Files** → **File Manager**
2. **Navigate to `public_html/`**
3. **Delete old files:**
   - Select all files in `public_html/`
   - Delete them (to ensure clean deployment)

4. **Upload new build contents:**
   - Upload ALL contents from your local `build/` folder
   - Upload to `public_html/` directory
   - Make sure `index.html` is directly in `public_html/`

5. **Verify `.htaccess` exists:**
   - Make sure `.htaccess` file is still in `public_html/`
   - If missing, recreate it

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache and Test

1. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Or clear cache:** `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` → Clear cached files
3. **Visit your site:** `https://yohhanssportswear.com`
4. **Open login modal:**
   - Error message should now show: `yohhanssportswear.com` ✅
   - Instead of: `yohanns-sportswear.onrender.com` ❌

## 📊 What Will Happen After Rebuild

**After you rebuild and redeploy:**

**On your Hostinger site (`yohhanssportswear.com`):**
- Error message will show: `yohhanssportswear.com` ✅
- Correct domain displayed!

**On localhost:**
- Error message will show: `localhost` ✅

**On any domain:**
- Error message will automatically show the correct domain! ✅

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

### After rebuilding and uploading:

1. **Visit your site:** `https://yohhanssportswear.com`
2. **Open browser console:** Press `F12`
3. **Open login modal:**
   - Click "Sign In" button
4. **Check the error message:**
   - Should say: "Ensure `yohhanssportswear.com` is added..."
   - NOT: "Ensure `yohanns-sportswear.onrender.com` is added..."

**If you still see the old domain:**
- Clear browser cache (hard refresh)
- Verify you uploaded the NEW build files
- Check that files were uploaded correctly

## 📝 Complete Checklist

**To fix the domain message:**

- [ ] Code is already updated ✅ (I just fixed it)
- [ ] Rebuild app: `npm run build`
- [ ] Delete old files from Hostinger `public_html/`
- [ ] Upload new `build/` contents to Hostinger
- [ ] Verify `.htaccess` file exists
- [ ] Clear browser cache: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- [ ] Test login modal - should show `yohhanssportswear.com` ✅

## 🎯 Why This Happens

**How React apps work:**

1. **Development:** Code changes → Browser auto-refreshes ✅
2. **Production:** Code changes → Must rebuild → Must redeploy ❌

**Your situation:**
- ✅ Code updated locally (on your computer)
- ❌ Old build still on Hostinger (deployed files)
- ✅ Need to rebuild and redeploy

**Think of it like:**
- Code = Source files (what you edit)
- Build = Compiled files (what users see)
- You changed the source, but need to rebuild the compiled version!

## 💡 Quick Summary

**The code is fixed!** But you're seeing the old message because:

1. **The fix is in the code** (already done) ✅
2. **But not in the deployed build** (needs rebuild) ❌
3. **Solution:** Rebuild (`npm run build`) and re-upload to Hostinger

**After rebuild:**
- Error message will show: `yohhanssportswear.com` ✅
- Instead of: `yohanns-sportswear.onrender.com` ❌

**Rebuild and redeploy now, and the error message will show the correct domain!** 🚀
