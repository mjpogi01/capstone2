                    ADD TO CART FUNCTIONS - FIX COMPLETE ‚úÖ
================================================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
  The "Add Cart" button on product cards was not functional.
  Clicking the button did nothing because it had no onClick handler.

ROOT CAUSE:
  File: src/components/customer/ProductCategories.js
  Line: 205
  Problem: Missing onClick handler on the button element

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

  1. Added onClick Handler to ProductCategories.js
     - Button now opens ProductModal when clicked
     - Passes product data to modal for customization
     - Prevents default behavior and event propagation

  2. Enhanced ProductModal.js with Debug Logging
     - Added console logs to track the add-to-cart flow
     - Helps identify issues in production
     - Includes: product name, cart options, user ID, success/failure

FILES MODIFIED:
  ‚úì src/components/customer/ProductCategories.js
  ‚úì src/components/customer/ProductModal.js
